            <h2 style="text-align: center">Design Documentation - SIMPLE Rework</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>At the beginning of fall 2016 semester, 2 biology professors at Stony Brook University came to the SBU Teaching Learning Lab to ask for help. They found out the SIMPLE web app is hard to navigate and use. SIMPLE stands for Simple Image Mapping Program for Learning Everything. It is a web-based interactive app developed by Stony Brook University Teaching Learning Lab for internal academic use. Users can upload customized PSD files to generate customized content. This app was originally created for a Stony Brook University biology class. The Lab decided to rework on this projct, and I was in charge of visuals and front-end part.</p>
            <center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SIMPLE_0.png"><br><br>SIMPLE Upload Interface</center>
            <br><br><br>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>We had a meeting with professors and identified 3 problems with the then-existing version of SIMPLE.</p>
            <center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SIMPLE_1.png"><br><br>Non-Responsive Layout</center><br><br>
            <p>1. The app was not web-responsive. Once windows size change, the interface would become distorted. <br> 2. The selector game was not cursor-accurate. Sometimes the cursor did not highlighting the hovered part. <br> 3. The typing game was totally broken and not funtional. <br><br> After we identified these mentioned problems, we found out that the last update for this app was back in 2010. The creater was a SBU student and already graduated. There was no way to get him back to work on this piece, so we decided to rework this app on our own.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>The Chanllenge</h3>
            <p>This web app was coded with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As we were examining the code, we found out the code structure was a mess. A real mess. A lot of redundant code. A lot of Javascript functions were poorly implemented. Multiple .css and .js files that were not effectively applied. After we identified the code files, we have concluded that to fix problems based on existing code was not a applicable and pleasure way. So we decided to completely rewrite the code, which means set up new code files and start from the ground.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>To start off, we identified that we had to cope with three parts: <br><br> 1. HTML structure <br> 2. CSS decoration/style <br> 3. Javascript funtions <br><br> Since this app is an one-page app (one HTML file), luckily, we were able to adopt the majority of original HTML code, and we improved them. HTML structure was redesigned for responsive layout. <br> For CSS files, we first cleaned up the code and created a unified single .css file. </p>
            <center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SIMPLE_4.png" width="25%"><br>Cleaning .css files</center><br><br>
            <p> Then we adopted the main color tone (background-color) from the original file and rewrote the rest of it. We used responsive-standard syntax. We redesigned button style, integrated Google fronts, and decorated the layout with a better visual design. </p>
            <center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SIMPLE_2.png" width="70%"><br>Redesign Button Style</center><br><br>
            <p>As for Javascript, there were too many broken functions and in multiple .js files, and they were a mess. We realized this was the reason why selector game and typing game were not working well, so we replaced all .js files with one single .js file and rewrote all functions in this file. </p>
            <center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SIMPLE_3.png" width="45%"><br>Cleaning .js files</center><br><br>
            <p>It was a quite challenging part, because we had to basically rewrite all functions, but we did it. Hahah. That was the part I learned the most out of this app. I encountered Javascript libraries, and I realized how powerful Javascript was. For this app, we used jQuery frequently.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Go for an Extra Mile</h3>
            <p>After we finished redesigning the app, we started to test its function. We iterated many times to fix visual and function problems. After we confirmed all original functions were working normal, the original goal was achieved. But then we thought about what could be added to the app. Since this was an app for academic use, <b><u>users would be professors and students</u></b>. <b>This was a critical part that inspired us to add some academic-related features</b>. After meetings and discussions with my supervisor, Paul, we came up 3 new insights: <br><br> 1. Add a Win/Lost interaface at end of each game. <br> 2. Embed a score system in the app. <br> 3. Enable professors to access the score result. <br><br> To add the Win/Lost interface, we went back to the CSS file and made the interface. The challenging part was the score system. We created a score system function in Javascript, but how to let professors have access to the scores? My supervisor showed me how to use PHP and AJAX to generate the score as a .xlsx file and upload to server. That was the first time I had a hand practice on back-end. </p>
            <center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SIMPLE_5.png"><br><br>AJAX and PHP Snippets</center><br><br>
            <p> After we done adding new features, we iterated several times to fix some minor problems. Then, we did a full test on responsive layout, index game, selector game, typing game, and the score system. We confirmed everything worked well. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>The Result</h3><br>
            <center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/SIMPLE_6.png"><br><br>Responsive Layout<br><br><br><br>

            <p>We sent an email out to announce that SIMPLE app was reworked. After several days, we heard back from professors about visuals, so according to the feedback, we made some minor visual design improvements (font size, font positions, sizes of buttons/menus). Then, we delivered SIMPLE to the university's app server. Since then, SIMPLE has been widely used among Stony Brook University natural science curriculums (biology, physics, chemistry, etc).</p>

            <br><br><br>
            <h3>Learning Outcome</h3>
            <p>There is not doubt that I learned a ton out of this web app. For design aspect, I acquired a better sense about visual layout. For front-end, I learned about responsive layout and reinforced my HTML/CSS skills. I encountered Javascript library, which I realized how powerful it was. It has so many choices to implement various functions. And for the first time, I had a hand practice on back-end. My supervisor, Paul, taught me how front-end and back-end work together. I had access to the university's web app server and gained insights about how to manage contents in a large scale environment. Paul also taught me a lot about shell scripting. I was able to access the app server with command line. Special thanks to Paul, Thank you. :) </p>
